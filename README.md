LabVIEW Toolkits for Developers

## What is LabVIEW?
LabVIEW stands for '[Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench](http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html). It is a graphical programing language (called "G") developed by [National Instruments](https://www.ni.com) for quick system application development. 

LabVIEW's "G" code is a combination of node/wire connections contained in a __Virtual Instrument__ (VI for short). Each VI contains the user interface (__Front Panel__), subroutine(s) (__Block Diagram__) and terminals (__Connector Pane__). VIs are connected together using the Connector Pane. LabVIEW is a "Data Flow" paradigm, meaning that once data is available at the terminal inputs the code is executed.  [Info](https://www.ni.com)

## What is ry.lib?
__ry.lib__ is a collection of open sourced LabVIEW toolkits and add-ons for large scale applications. These libraries were developed from best practices during my career as a [Certified LabVIEW Architect (CLA)](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/13477).

Projects:
1. [ry.lib](https://github.com/rcpacini/rylib/tree/master/rylib) (Library) contain standard libraries built for advanced application development. These libraries are extensions of LabVIEW's vi.lib to handle basic functionality every application needs: multi-threading, multiple user interfaces, periodic messaging, error logging and hardware abstraction.

2. [ry.qd](https://github.com/rcpacini/rylib/tree/master/ryqd) (Quick Drop) contain macros for faster LabVIEW development. These tools speed up common tasks within the LabVIEW environment such as, changing data types, resizing diagram content, re-aranging terminals and modifying node attributes.

## Getting Started
1. [Install LabVIEW 2017](http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview/download.html) (or later)
2. Download the ry.Lib VI Packages [here](https://github.com/rcpacini/rylib/tree/master/builds)
3. Install the VI Packages using [VI Package Manager](https://vipm.jki.net/) (installed with LabVIEW)
4. Refer to the ry.Lib toolkit and add-on help documentation [here](https://github.com/rcpacini/rylib/tree/master/docs)
